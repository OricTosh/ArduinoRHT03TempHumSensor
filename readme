Arduino Code which will read temperature and humidity from a DHT22(RHT03) sensor
Dew point is also worked out and displayed as this gives a better indication of within the air 

This project has a 24x4 LCD for local display of data 
This display is updated every 3 secs, It's currently sat inside my filament box
So I'm able to see the conditions that my filament is being stored in.

Later upgrades are:
Be battery powered
Have Bluetooth connection for local data collection.
Become a lora node for upload to gateway and the things network.
