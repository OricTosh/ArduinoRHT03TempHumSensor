Arduino Code which will read temperature and humidity from a DHT22(RHT03) sensor

Will publish the data to https://xively.com/ so becoming an IOT (Internet Of Things device)

Has A LCD for local display of data to the people within the hackerspace.
This display is updated every 3 secs and then the data is uploaded to Xively every 5 Mins.
There is also a LED which turns ON & Off every time it uploads data so to give 
some local feedback to say it's working ok.

Things to add:
Show & Upload Average 
Show Max & Min Temperature and Humidity

Temperature has been checked with another Temperature Device which show the same temperature
